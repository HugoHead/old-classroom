# old-classroom
This is a collaborative effort by Dane ([@DangerDC](https://github.com/DangerDC)) and Adithya ([@HugoHead](https://github.com/HugoHead)) to fix the horror google has applyed to google classroom's theme. As students forced to use this software, we beleve that we have a right to a useable interface. Since we have not been provided with any such thing, we choose to stand of above the masses and do what is right.
